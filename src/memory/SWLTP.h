* M2S SWLTP With LTP Implementation

*
* The SWLTP class is the implementation of a last-touch (dead-block) predictor. It makes use of 
* a history table to hold generated traces as accesses to memory are made, and a last touch history table
* which is used to compare the currently generated trace for a block to the previous last-held trace in the
* history table when that block was evicted last.
